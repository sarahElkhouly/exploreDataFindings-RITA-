# (Airline Delay Causes Data Exploration)
## by Sarah Elkhouly


## Dataset

> The data comes originally from RITA where it is described in detail, it contains data about airlines ,flights ,timing..etc
with causes of delays of flights with more information about flights delays.
there is 175915 of Summary information entity on the number of on-time, delayed and diverted flights every month, In the dataset with 21 features.

## Summary of Findings

> I want to know the most reliable features with flights delays and if there are any features that surprisingly effect the airlines flights delays and how every airline performance changed over time.
So, I think the investigation will be supported by the type or cause of flights delays and number of delayed flights.

*  The highest quantity of information we have of flights occurred in the years of 2019 and 2018, The least number is in the year of 2016 and 2017.
* The (OO) airline carrier abbreviation has the greatest share of flights in the dataset.
*   the most airport that we have information about id Detroit Metro Wayne Country Airport.
*  we can say that the most month repeated with arriving flights is December mainly because people prefer to travel during the holidays.
* there is a positive correlation between the number of delayed flights of every airport and the total number of arriving flights.
* he carrier corporation with the most number of delayed flights (with more that 15 minutes delay) is SouthWest Airlines Corporation.
* We can see that carrier corporation with the most number of canceled flights is SouthWest Airlines Corporation.
* I can't help but notice that SouthWest Airlines Corporation has the most no of delayed flights which let me think why they have that large number of delayed flights, mostly because they have a serious problem and they need to solve it as fast as possible.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> Firstly, in my presentation I will start with exploring my dataset by my plots and visualization of data.
> secondly, I will introduce and explain the data findings of univariant, bivariant and multi variant plots, Using scatter plots and different kinds of barplots.
